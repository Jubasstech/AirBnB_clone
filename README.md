About the Projects
Be pycodestyle compliant!
mandatory
Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks
All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests
Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes:

models/base_model.py
Public instance attributes:
id: string - assign with an uuid when an instance is created:
you can use uuid.uuid4() to generate unique id but don’t forget to convert to a string
the goal is to have unique id for each BaseModel
created_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created
updated_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created and it will be updated every time you change your object
__str__: should print: [<class name>] (<self.id>) <self.__dict__>
Public instance methods:
save(self): updates the public instance attribute updated_at with the current datetime
to_dict(self): returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of __dict__ of the instance:
by using self.__dict__, only instance attributes set will be returned
a key __class__ must be added to this dictionary with the class name of the object
created_at and updated_at must be converted to string object in ISO format:
format: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f (ex: 2017-06-14T22:31:03.285259)
you can use isoformat() of datetime object
This method will be the first piece of the serialization/deserialization process: create a dictionary representation with “simple object type” of our BaseModel
